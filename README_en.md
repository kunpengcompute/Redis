# Redis Network Optimization Features

## Project Brand Name
Kunpeng BoostKit Redis

## Change Notification
- [2026-03-05] Reconstructed `README`.
- [2025-03-30] Released the user guide and release notes for the Redis network asynchronization feature.
- [2025-02-28] Supported the network asynchronous optimization capability of Redis 7.0.15.

## Project Introduction
This repository provides content related to Redis network asynchronization. The core capability is the Kunpeng Redis Asynchronous I/O (KRAIO) solution and its patches.

Asynchronous batch processing of Redis network I/O operations can reduce system calls and context switching, thus improving throughput. Currently, this repository provides the adaptation patches and documents for Redis 6.0.20 and 7.0.15.

## Release Notes
The release notes include the software version mapping, feature changes, and issue description. For details, see:

- `docs/en/redis_network_async_optimization_release_notes.md`

## Quick Start
The following uses Redis 7.0.15 as an example.

```bash
# (1) Prepare kraio and install the library file.
cd kraio
make -j4
cp ./libkraio.so /usr/lib64
cp ./include/kraio.h /usr/include

# (2) Apply the patch and compile Redis.
cd /path/to/redis-7.0.15
cp /path/to/Redis/redis-7.0.15-adapt-iouring.patch .
patch -p1 < redis-7.0.15-adapt-iouring.patch
make distclean
make -j
```

For details about the environment preparation, configuration, and verification, see:
- `docs/en/redis_network_async_optimization_feature_guide.md`
